# Hey there, I'm James 👨🏻‍💻

**Technical Program & Product Leader**

I help scaling software companies win enterprise customers by turning compliance, security, and reliability into competitive advantages.

## 🎯 What I Do

I drive strategy and execution for critical non-functional capabilities required for products to scale beyond early adopters and succeed in regulated, high-trust markets.

When built strategically, these capabilities don’t slow growth; they enable it, unlocking larger deals, new industries, and long-term platform viability.

**Being loved by users is valuable. Being approved by enterprise procurement is a game-changer.**

### Current Focus
- 🔐 Product Management for platform compliance at HashiCorp
- ✍️ Running the [TPM Craft Newsletter](https://tpmcraft.substack.com/)
- 📚 Co-authoring **a top secret project** with Packt Publishing
- 🛠️ Building family-focused and personal health product experiments

## 🌟 What Makes Me Special (just like everyone else)

I've had multiple roles across strategy and execution. I've seen how the sausage is made. I've made the sausage.
- **Strategic Thinking:** Good execution on bad ideas isn't worth very much. My time in Product has shaped how I see through the lens of the customer and business drivers.
- **Technical Aptitude:** System architecture and tech debt? Let's chat. Working with engineering feels very natural to me...because I've been in their shoes.
- **Execution Excellence:** Execution with 1 team is easy. Building an engine of large, cross-functional execution across 20 teams is a different game.
- **Systems Thinking:** The butterfly effect isn't theoretical, but it is often dismissed in an organizational setting. Cross-company dependencies are a wild thing.
- **Builder Mentality:** I don't just spec products, I build them by utilizing my prior time as a mid-level engineer.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### MoneyBuckets
**Financial Literacy for Kids**

An envelope-style budgeting app teaching children money management through:
- 🎨 Visual bucket metaphors kids understand
- 💵 Real-world transaction tracking
- 🎯 Goal-setting and savings visualization
- 📈 Parent oversight without micromanagement

**Status:** ✅ Actively Used (privately, not publicly launched)
**AI Assistant:** Claude Code
**Tech Stack:** AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB), React  
**Product Insight:** Designed with the principle that financial literacy starts with tangible, foundational concepts such as: (1) money is earned (not given), (2) think of the future with an intentional savings plan, (3) always set aside funds to be generous, and (4) guilt-free spending is awesome when you've taken care of all other priorities.


### HomeFlow
**Family Operating System for Modern Life**

A comprehensive task management platform designed for families, featuring:
- 🎯 Momentum Anchors - Monthly planning cycles that actually work
- 📊 Smart task distribution and accountability tracking
- 💰 Integrated financial education (MoneyBuckets)
- 📚 Homeschool scheduling and progress tracking

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress (likely 80% complete until MVP readiness)
**AI Assistant:** Codex
**Tech Stack:** React, AWS Amplify, DynamoDB, Cognito  
**Product Insight:** Built to solve the real problem of coordinating complex family logistics - from chores to rewards to marriage unity - in one cohesive system.


### Consistency Protocol
**Frictionless Fitness Habit Building**

A structured workout application designed to turn fitness intentions into unbreakable habits through:
- 🗓️ Pre-planned daily routines that eliminate decision fatigue
- ⏱️ Immersive, guided interval timers with integrated form-checking
- 🤝 Psychological buy-in via forward-looking workout commitments
- 🟩 Visual proof of identity with a 90-day GitHub-style consistency grid

**Status:** 🔄 In Progress (personal beta testing starting soon, but eventually need to move change it to a native mobile app using Flutter)
**AI Assistant:** Gemini via Google AI Studio
**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
**Product Insight:** Designed with the principle that motivation follows action; building an identity as an athlete through visual proof of consistency is far more powerful than tracking complex performance metrics.
