# Hey there, I'm James 👋

**Technical Program Manager & Product Manager** 
Building capabilities at the intersection of infrastructure compliance, security, and reliability.

## 🎯 What I Do

I drive strategy and execution for the non-functional requirements that take our products from niche customers to enterprise markets. Currently focused on compliance and security products at HashiCorp, I bring a unique blend of technical depth and product thinking shaped by years as a TPM.

### Current Focus

- ✍️ Running the [TPM Craft Newsletter](https://tpmcraft.substack.com/)

## 💡 Product Philosophy

> "I approach product development like RPG character development - continuous learning, skill stacking, and systematic improvement."

I believe great products come from:
1. **Deep user empathy** - Solving real problems, not hypothetical ones
2. **Technical credibility** - Understanding what's possible AND what's practical
3. **Systematic thinking** - Frameworks and processes that scale
4. **Iterative delivery** - Ship, learn, improve, repeat

## 🌟 What Makes Me Different

I've had multiple roles across strategy and execution. I've seen how the sausage is made.
- **Strategic Thinking:** Good execution on bad ideas isn't worth very much
- **Technical Aptitude:** System architecture and tech debt, let's chat.
- **Execution Excellence:** Execution with 1 team is easy. Building an engine of large, cross-functional execution across 20 teams is a different game.
- **Systems Thinking:** The butterfly effect isn't theoretical, but it is often dismissed in an organizational setting.
- **Builder Mentality:** I don't just spec products, I build them by utilizing my prior experience as a front-end and API engineer
