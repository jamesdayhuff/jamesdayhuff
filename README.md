## 💡 Product Philosophy

> "I approach product development like RPG character development - continuous learning, skill stacking, and systematic improvement."

I believe great products come from:
1. **Deep user empathy** - Solving real problems, not hypothetical ones
2. **Technical credibility** - Understanding what's possible AND what's practical
3. **Systematic thinking** - Frameworks and processes that scale
4. **Iterative delivery** - Ship, learn, improve, repeat
